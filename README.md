# 8 Queens GUI
The purpose of this assignment is to implement the 8 queens algorithm on a GUI chessboard.
If you're not familiar with the 8 queens problem, the 8 queens algorithm is supposed to figure out the optimal space for all 8 queens on a chessboard. Each queen should be placed in a space that shouldn't have a queen horizontal or vertical or diagonal from where that queen is placed.

This GUI was made on Intellij.
